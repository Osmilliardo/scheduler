# Word Day Schedule/Planner

## Description


The motivation for this project was to make a planner that could let the user know throughout a work day when certain tasks were occuring, as well as add  those tasks to their schedule

This project was made to help keep individuals, like myself, who may occassionally need help staying organized, keep their days straight.

I made mention on the last challenge that I had some trouble understanding some of how to use javascript. A lot of this project was making sense of those things that I didn't quite get, there was a lot of "Aha!" moments that gave me a considerable amount more confidence in javascript as I move forward.
